What is a Terraform Module?
A Terraform module is a set of Terraform configuration files in a single directory.
Even a simple configuration consisting of a single directory with one or more .tf files is a module.
When you run Terraform commands directly from such a directory, it is considered the root module.
So in this sense, every Terraform configuration is part of a module. You may have a simple set of
Terraform configuration files such as:
.
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── main.tf
├── variables.tf
├── outputs.tf

In this case, when you run terraform commands from within the minimal-module directory,
the contents of that directory are considered the root module.
