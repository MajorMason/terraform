Assigning an Identity to Terraform
-------------------------------------
(for direct deployments without a build pipeline)
Since we need to give Terraform itself an identity, we need to register is as an application
in Azure, and we do this through Entra ID > App Registrations > then fill out the details

Now we can assign the permissions within the subscription we're deploying into, so we will
click into our subscription > select Access Control IAM > and give our new app registration
the Contributor role > assign access to User, Group or Service Principal > then select member


Managed Identity VS. Service Principal VS. App Registrations
---------------------------------------------------------------
(for deployments with a build pipeline, you must create an app registration)
Managed Identity - Use this if you don't have permissions to create service principals or
if you are using a different Entra ID tenant than your ADO user. MIs are a special type of
service principal and are lifecycle managed meaning when the resource is deleted, the MI is too.
MIs are good for 

Service Principal - Are created automatically from app registrations and support multi-tenant
scenarios. These are ideal for applications that authenticate across different environments such
as ADO build pipelines or any applications outside of Azure.

App Registrations - These are separate from MIs and SPs, but still are relevant to this section
because an App Registration will automatically create an SP. You need app registrations in order
to provide an identity/connection from either VSCode (Terraform), Azure DevOps Build Pipelines, or
any other external application outside of Azure Cloud specifically.


Generating & Assigning a Client Secret (Optional)
----------------------------------------
Then we Review + Assign to finalize it. Now we're going to go back over to Entra ID > then
choose app registration > Manage drop down then Certificates & secrets where we'll generate
a new client secret

The ARM Client Secret is the "value" on the Certs & secrets page in Azure Entra ID for the app reg
ARM Client ID = Application (client) ID
ARM Tenant ID = Directory (tenant) ID
ARM Subscription ID = Subscription ID
