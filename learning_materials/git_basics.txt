Start by installing git from the official git website (don't try to use the posh module).
Once git is installed, restart VSCode.

Once VSCode is up, run "git init" to initialize your directory you're working in.
Then, use "git add ." to track files between VSCode and the github repository.

Finally, use "git commit -m "commit message as desired".
Note: If you receive an error "Author identity unknown" then modify the gitconfig file located
in the directory you installed Git in (default is ProgramFiles\Git) and in that gitconfig file,
make sure to add the following lines at the bottom (with indentations):
[user]
    name = (your exact name as listed on github)
    email = (email associated with your github login)

And you're done! You should be ready for git commits now to your github repository.

Tip: If you tried installing posh-git but then tried uninstalling the module and receieve
and error message each POSH startup, just look up your variable $PROFILE and track down the
file it lists, then remove the "import git-module" from your profile file.

NOTE: If gitignore is failing to ignore large files such as the included terraform provider file or
another executable, you'll need to delete the "git" folder from the project using file explorer
(making sure to reveal hidden items) then run a "git init" to reinitialize the directory.
